# Grocery Backend
This is the api and webscraper I'm building to display current grocery store prices. 
## How it's made:
Node/Express.js with TypeScript, MongoDB?
## Optimizations
Would be better to just find an API that has grocery store price data, but I want to make a webscraper.
## Lessons Learned
This is the first time I'm using typescript with express and I expect to learn a lot.
